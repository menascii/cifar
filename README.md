   cifar training program in c++ by menascii
   
   compile:
      
      g++ training_cifar.cpp

   run:
   	  
      ./a.out

   input:
      
      hardcoded file name for 60,000 cifar training images  
      download training data from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
         
      train-images.bin
         
   output:
         
         write updated model weights to file   

   note:
  	     
         this program just reads the cifar training images and print the images 
  	     in a local directory. i will update the convolutional neural network process soon.
